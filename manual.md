# Epichat / irc

Hi and welcome to Epichat / irc.

real time chat app with socket.io, node and react.

## installation.

in order to make it work you need to type **'npm i'** or **'npm install'** in the terminal 
of each of the following directories:

#### client
#### server

## Launch.

Now that is done go to terminal of the 'client' and type **'npm start'**
in order to launch the app.

Then go to terminal of the 'server' and type **'node server.js'**
so the front and back can communication with each other.

## Caution.

if the server isn't started yet the main function the app won't work

so don't forget to fire up the server as well ;)

you hae to type a username in the chat page or the chat interface won't show up correctly.
